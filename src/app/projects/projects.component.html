            <h1>Lusty's Minecraft World</h1>
            <p>Lusty's Minecraft World is a website that showcases the minecraft server owned by myself, that others can
                join and play together.
                It was built using only Angular and ngx-bootstrap for styling and other functionality. It was fun to
                make as a personal project. </p>

            <h1>Credit card Manager demo</h1>
            <p>The credit card manager was built to hone my skills in Angular state management and was given to me by a
                senior in the field.
                It was a great learning experience for me.</p>

            <h1>SMPLive</h1>
            <p>SMPLive is a web resource I built to host information about various Minecraft SMP servers such as Dream
                SMP, Origins SMP and an existing server of the same name(no affiliation) SMP Live.
                The site hosts information on the lore of some of the SMPs and the players on it. </p>

            <h1>SLDB</h1>
            <p>SLDB(Service Life Database) is a website I built as a commision with a friend and partner of mine <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tope-adefemi-323a96201/" target="_blank">@Femi Black<i
                        class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> </a> for the purpose of
                storing and retrieving data on several buildings that have undergone specific maintenance and checks.
                <br>
                There were a few hurdles to jump through as the data was many and varied and neither of us had worked
                with such amounts of data before. <br>
                The project was completed successfully and two versions of it ended up being developed, one in Vue(@Femi
                Black) and one in Angular(Me) with the backend for both developed by @Femi Black
